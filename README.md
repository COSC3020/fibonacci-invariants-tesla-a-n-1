# Fibonacci Invariants

Recall the definition of the Fibonacci series: the first number is 0, the second
1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers preceding it.
Implement a function that computes the Fibonacci numbers recursively, storing
the results in an array.

For example, the return value of `fib(7)` is the following array:

| index |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value |  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  5  |  8  |  13 |

Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some basic
testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Invariant

What is a good invariant for your recursive implementation of `fib()`
i.e. something that is always true at the beginning of the recursive call?

Hint: Think about what the "state of the world" is here and what you can say
about it at the start of each recursive call. Your invariant must say something
about the current recursive call.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. You do not need to prove that the invariant is correct. Add
your answer to this markdown file.

A good invariant would be to assume the previous 2 numbers in the sequence ((n-1) and (n-2)) are correct
when summing them. The base cases fib(0) and fib(1) are correct by initialization so when summing them,
the invariant guarantees that the previous calculation is correct and the sequence is built on valid
previous values.

I wrote the initial code, classmate in functional programming who took this class in the past
provided guidance on better approach to only use one recursive call rather than two in the 
line that pushes the next fibonacci value onto the sequence. Slides and notes from class 
are where I figured the invariant from. Otherwise: "I certify that I have listed all sources used to complete this exercise, including the use of any Large Language Models.
